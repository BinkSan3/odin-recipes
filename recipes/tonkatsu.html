        <h3>What is Delicious Tonkatsu?</h3>

        <p>If you're into your Japanese Cuisine then Tonkatsu is a must have in your recipe arsenal. This panko-fried style dish can be enjoyed as the main to a set meal with rice vegetables and miso soup, or can be enjoyed as a snack/light meal to accompany a cold beer.</p>

        <p>Ton <sup>meaning pork</sup> Katsu<sup>short for cutlet</sup> is like the name suggests; a dish that consists of a breaded deep fried pork cutlet. It involves coating slices of eith pork loin or fillet in panko (bread crumbs) and deep frying them golden and ejoyed with a choice of various sauce and salad. It is also the katsu genarally used in katsu curry across Japan (although the west tend to favour chicken!). </p>
