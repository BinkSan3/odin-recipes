        <p>Whether at a beach bar on holiday, or in your own back garden having a barbeque, the Mojito is a Fantastic drink to get those summer feels!</p>

        <h2>What is a Mojito?</h2>
        <p>The Mojito is a classic Cuban drink that uses ingredients native to Cuba; rum, lime, mint and sugar. This mix is then topped off with a little club soda to create a balance of freshness that those summer tastebuds can't resist. Normally served in a highball glass, this drink takes a little more labour than a lot of mixed drinks but it is well worth that taste of weightlessness.</p>

        <p>We are going to make a perfected Mojito through years of baretending experience. There are always variations depending on who made it and where it was made. This way we think is the best flavour possible! Of course don't be afraid to substute certain things for you own convenience.</p>

        <h2>Mojito Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rum.</strong> Always white for a Mojito. Some experimental people have surely used dark but a classic is always white to keep that freshness. Avoid spiced at all cost.</li>
            <li><strong>Mint.</strong> Spearmint is what you generally find at the shops and works perfectly. If you have access, then use <em>Mentha x villosa,</em> the native Cuban mint.</li>
            <li><strong>Lime.</strong> Use fresh limes. Have a feel make sure they're smooth and feel juicy.</li>
            <li><strong>Demerara Sugar.</strong> Most people often use simple suger syrup or fine granulated white suger for ease but we think that brown suger really give a little depth to the flavour. Plus, the odd granule is a welcome sensation! </li>
            <li><strong>Club Soda.</strong> To top the drink to balance out the drink. Any club soda is ok.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Utensils</h2>
        <p>To make this drink easer to make you will need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Highball glasses</li>
            <li>Muddler</li>
            <li>Barspoon</li>
            <li>Jigger to measure liquids</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ingredients (for 1)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10-12 (or a good handful) fresh picked mint leaves</li>
            <li>5-6 lime wedges (half a lime should get 4 wedges).</li>
            <li>Crushed ice on hand. Traditionally cubed but we find that crushed cools the drink better and also helps filter any bits of mint.</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons demerara brown suger, or to taste.</li>
            <li>50ml white rum.</li>
            <li>Club soda ready to top.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put sugar into glass and roughly muddle with the muddler to grind down a little.</li>
            <li>Squeeze lime wedges into glass, drop in and muddle.</li>
            <li>Add rum.</li>
            <li>Grab the mint in the palm of your hand and use your other hand to slap the mint. This will activate the mint aromas. Drop into the glass. Muddle again.</li>
            <li>Add crushed ice roughly a centimetre away from the rim.</li>
            <li>Now grab the bar spoon and muddle with a vigor (but dont break the glass!) Use a paper towel or serviette to cover the top to stop ice going everywhere. Dont worry too much though, it's all part of the process). Do this for about 20 seconds and push the mint and lime towards the bottom on the last few strokes.</li>
            <li>Top with more crushed ice to the top. and top with soda. Generally it just a dash of soda (around 50ml give or take depending on the glass).</li>
            <li>You will need a straw to drink this one so att a straw. Take a mint sprig (the top 8cm of the stalk with 4 leaves still at the top) hit the tip gently against the back of your had and place next to the straw in the drink. This will give a fresh minty aroma as you go to drink it. Feel free to garnish with a lime wheel also.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>And there you have it! Our perfected Mojito.</p>

        <h2>baretenders Note:</h2>
        <p>Feel free to use more or less of any of the ingredients to balance it to your liking. If you like a sweeter Mojito, add more sugar etc...</p>
        <p>You can also use lemonade instead of soda water for a sweeter drink or tonic water for a sweeter yet better flavour.</p>
        <p>If you want to make your own sugar syrup we recommend a 2 parts sugar to 1 part water ratio.</p>
